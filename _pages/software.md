In addition to producing scientific publications ANSI also strives to contribute to the community via open-source software, which is curated in the [ANSI Github Organization](https://github.com/lanl-ansi).  A selection of our favorite open-source projects are highlighted below.


## Infrastructure Networks

* [GasGridModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/GasGridModels.jl) (julia) - joint optimization of power and natural gas transmission networks.
* [GasModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/GasModels.jl) (julia) - simulation and optimization methods for steady-state natural gas transmission networks.
* [MICOT](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/micot) (java) - a generic framework for optimization and control of infrastructure networks.
* [PowerModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl) (julia) - simulation and optimization methods for power transmission networks.
* [WaterModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/WaterModels.jl) (julia) - simulation and optimization methods for potable water networks.


## Optimization Algorithms

* [Alpine.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/Alpine.jl) (julia) - a global optimization solver for non-convex MINLP.
* [Gravity](https://github.com/Allinsights/Gravity) (c++) - a high-performance modeling layer for MINLP and MISDP.
